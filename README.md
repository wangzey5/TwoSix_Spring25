# CMSE 495 Capstone Project: Analyzing Public Feedback on Environmental Policies Using NLP

This project is part of **CMSE 495**, the final-year undergraduate capstone course for data science and computational data science majors at Michigan State University. The course involves team-based projects in collaboration with industry partners, where students develop and deliver data-driven solutions over the semester.

Our team is collaborating with **[Two Six Technologies](https://twosixtech.com/)** on the project **"Analyzing Public Feedback on Environmental Policies Using Natural Language Processing."** The goal is to analyze public responses to environmental policies using NLP techniques. To achieve this, we are scraping comments from climate-related documents in the **[Federal Register](https://www.regulations.gov/)** and storing them in **MongoDB** for further analysis.

### Technologies Used:
- **HPCC** for high-performance computing and database storage  
- **MongoDB** and **ChromaDB** for data storage, retrieval, and indexing  
- **PHATE** for visualization and dimensionality reduction of text embeddings  
- **Python** for modeling and analysis
